                    General biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment, encompassing topics like cell biology, genetics, physiology, ecology, and evolution. It examines the structure, function, growth, and development of organisms, as well as the mechanisms behind heredity and the processes that drive natural selection and adaptation. This broad field serves as a foundation for more specialized branches of biology, offering essential insights into the complexity of life and the diverse ways organisms adapt and survive in different ecosystems.
